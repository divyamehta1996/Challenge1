      Dear ÉCOLE team,
    </p>

    <p>
      I am thrilled to apply for the computer science intern role at École in New York City. My academic coursework,
      self-taught programming skills, and creative drive make me an excellent fit for this position, one that would
      require me to juggle many responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Princeton University I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science and Engineering degree in the Computer Science department, where through my Introduction to Computer Science, Introduction to Programming Systems, and Algorithms & Data Structures classes I’ve gained strong technical abilities in Java and C. Beyond this, I have studied Ruby, Rails, and Javascript programming languages independently outside of the classroom. I have applied these languages in my previous internships and on-campus activities. In sum, my academic coursework combined with my learning outside of the classroom have equipped me with strong technical skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, I have sharpened my creative skills through my involvement in the arts.  I have learned various dance forms over the past 13 years including ballet, jazz, and traditional Indian dance. On campus I choreograph for BAC: Hip-Hop Dance Company and Naacho: South Asian Dance Company. These organizations have also helped me hone my teamwork and leadership skills, working with new and experienced dancers alike. In addition, I am involved with Fashion Speaks, a charity fashion show, on the purchasing and budgeting arm. As an event-planning intern at AUM Events, I worked with many boutique fashion designers and worked backstage at high profile fashion shows such as Miss India USA and Miss America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, my creative skills can prove to be an asset at École to extend beyond the technical aspects of the job and contribute in a significant way to the company’s growth in the fashion field.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am also vastly involved on campus in a variety of student organizations. At Business Today, a completely student run non-profit organization, I manage sponsor revenue, conference speaker outreach, and the web tech analytics team. Over the past year, the team has created an app for all three of our conferences, introduced long form articles in our Online Journal platform, and began the initial stages of development for a new website. Through additional organizations such as the Entrepreneurship Club, Women’s Mentorship and Pi Beta Phi, I have developed a strong set of communication, management, and leadership tools. I know École is looking for an intern that can combine these key tools with a technical understanding of the business in order to truly be an asset to the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      ÉCOLE’s vision motivated me to apply for this position. I have always been interested in fashion and the intersection of this huge industry with technology. I would thrive in a fast-paced growing environment. As founder and president of Liberate The Chains, a charity organization committed to spreading awareness and raising funds for the anti-trafficking campaign, I understand how to address the hurdles that come with a start-up organization.
